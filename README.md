## Features

- üîç Decode and inspect JWT tokens
- üîë Multi-threaded CPU brute-force for JWT secrets
- ‚ö° GPU-accelerated brute-force using OpenCL
- üìä Performance metrics tracking (hashes/sec)
- üöÄ Optimized for high-performance computing

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- OpenSSL 3.x
- OpenCL compatible GPU (for GPU acceleration)
- CMake 3.10+
- nlohmann/json library

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tldr-it-stepankutaj/jwt_inspector.git
cd jwt_inspector

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

From the provided source code, JWT Inspector appears to run directly using token and wordlist files specified in the code. The application reads the token from `data/sample_token.txt` and the wordlist from `data/wordlist.txt`.

```bash
./jwt_inspector
```

Example output:
```
üì¶ Loaded JWT token:

üîë Token signature bytes: 32 bytes
üìä Total secrets to test: 10000

‚è±Ô∏è Time: 0.1234 sec
‚ö° Hashes/sec: 81037
‚úÖ Secret FOUND: "supersecret" at index 5123
```

Additionally, based on the shared code, it appears there are other JWT decoding and bruteforce capabilities in the codebase that may be available through modifications to `main.cpp`. The `JWTDecoder` class includes:

1. `decode()` - For decoding and inspecting tokens
2. `bruteforce_secret()` - For CPU-based brute-force
3. `bruteforce_secret_multithreaded()` - For multi-threaded CPU brute-force

The `JWTBruteForcer` class provides GPU-accelerated brute-force capabilities.

Example output:
```

## Architecture

The project is organized as follows:

- `include/`: Header files
  - `jwt_decoder.hpp`: CPU-based JWT operations
  - `jwt_bruteforce.hpp`: OpenCL-accelerated brute-force
- `src/`: Implementation files
  - `main.cpp`: Command-line interface
  - `jwt_decoder.cpp`: JWT decoding and CPU brute-force
  - `jwt_bruteforce.cpp`: OpenCL setup and execution
- `kernels/`: OpenCL kernel code
  - `hmac_sha256.cl`: HMAC-SHA256 implementation for GPU
- `data/`: Sample data
  - `sample_token.txt`: Example JWT to test with
  - `wordlist.txt`: Dictionary for brute-force attempts

## How It Works

JWT Inspector uses two key approaches for secret discovery:

1. **CPU Multi-Threading**: Divides the wordlist into chunks and assigns them to separate threads for parallel processing.

2. **GPU Acceleration**: Offloads the computation-intensive HMAC-SHA256 operations to the GPU using OpenCL, enabling thousands of attempts per second.

The OpenCL kernel implements a streamlined version of HMAC-SHA256 specifically optimized for brute-force operations, with a focus on performance rather than completeness.

## Performance

Performance varies based on hardware, but typical results:

- **CPU Multi-Threaded**: ~10,000-30,000 hashes/sec (depends on core count)
- **GPU-Accelerated**: ~50,000-500,000 hashes/sec (depends on GPU model)
